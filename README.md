CAPTCHA Generator and Verifier:
Generator: Create a simple CAPTCHA using HTML/CSS to display a randomly generated combination of characters or images. Use JavaScript to generate these random combinations and display them on the page.
Verifier: Implement a verification mechanism where users input the displayed CAPTCHA value and verify it using JavaScript. Compare the user input with the generated CAPTCHA to check for correctness.
Interactive Quiz:
Create an HTML structure for three questions and their corresponding options.
Use CSS for styling and layout.
Use JavaScript to handle user interactions such as selecting options and providing feedback on the score after the submit button is clicked.
Image Gallery with Popup View:
Display a set of images using HTML/CSS. Each image should be clickable.
Use JavaScript to create a popup/modal that appears when users click on an image. The popup should display the clicked image in a larger size. Implement functionality to close the popup.
Fetching and Filtering Post Data from Mock API:
Use fetch() in JavaScript to retrieve data from the given API endpoint (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).
Parse the retrieved JSON data and filter it based on a given title.
Use try-catch for proper error handling in case of fetch failures or other errors during the data retrieval and filtering process.
